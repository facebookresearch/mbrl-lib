    """Wraps a dynamics model into a gym-like environment.

    This class can wrap a dynamics model to be used as an environment. The only requirement
    to use this class is for the model to use this wrapper is to have a method called
    ``predict()``
    with signature `next_observs, rewards = model.predict(obs,actions, sample=, rng=)`

    Args:
        env (gym.Env): the original gym environment for which the model was trained.
        model (:class:`mbrl.models.Model`): the model to wrap.
        termination_fn (callable): a function that receives actions and observations, and
            returns a boolean flag indicating whether the episode should end or not.
        reward_fn (callable, optional): a function that receives actions and observations
            and returns the value of the resulting reward in the environment.
            Defaults to ``None``, in which case predicted rewards will be used.
        generator (torch.Generator, optional): a torch random number generator (must be in the
            same device as the given model). If None (default value), a new generator will be
            created using the default torch seed.
